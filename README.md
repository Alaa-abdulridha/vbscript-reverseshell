# vbscript-reverseshell
This is asp vbscript reverse shell used to bypass outbound closed connections.


## Usage
Upload the reverse shell on your web server as `example.asp` and then access it from the browser.
Don't forget to replace the `YOUR_BIND_IP` with your bindshell IP and the port below `1313` with your bind shell port.

## Obfuscated Version
You can find the obfuscated version of the reverse shell, it still readable and it might be detected by some anti-viruses but atleast it won't be detected by some older windows defender version.
Tested on windows defender in windows server 2008 R2 and windows server 2012 also on Kaspersky.
